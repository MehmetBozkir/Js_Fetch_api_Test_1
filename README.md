What does Fetch API do?

Fetch API is a JavaScript API that is used by web applications to access and interact with resources (JSON, HTML, images, videos, etc.) over the network. It is an asynchronous structure that can be used as an alternative to Ajax.

Fetch API allows you to do the following:

- Send HTTP requests to a web page, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Receive and parse HTTP responses
- Read and write HTTP response headers
- Make caching settings for HTTP request
